# SE-HCMUS-PROJECT
An Introduction to Engineering electronic online market project

## Introduction
With the rising of technology and service industry, people no longer have to directly go to a store to buy what
they need. Instead, There are software and websites that allow them to access any products from any store
just by staying indoor. Therefore, our group decided to build a similar platform that is for electronics trades
called _E-tech_.

_E-tech_ is an online sale platform for electronic goods. Our project is based on many similar famous online
markets such as _**Amazon**_, _**Lazada**_, _**Alibaba**_, .etc. For the previous mentioned reasons, _E-tech_ is a worthy
project to operate as it fulfill peopleâ€™s need for convenience as well as giving enterprises reach to their
customers faster and easier

## Target users and Environemnt
### Targer users
There will be 2 main users that E-tech is aiming to:

- Sellers: These are enterprises such as _**Sony**_, _**Logitech**_, _**Asus**_, .etc, and individuals who want to sell their
electronic devices .

- Buyers: People who are interested in buying electronic goods, aging from around 18 to 40, especially
those whose job involves computer; and gamers.

### Target environment
Our project will be operated as a website via the Internet, using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for interface, and
Typescript, Nodejs, Python for backend development.
