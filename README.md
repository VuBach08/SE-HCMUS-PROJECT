# SE-HCMUS-PROJECT
An Introduction to Engineering electronic online market project

##Introduction
With the rising of technology and service industry, people no longer have to directly go to a store to buy what
they need. Instead, There are software and websites that allow them to access any products from any store
just by staying indoor. Therefore, our group decided to build a similar platform that is for electronics trades
called E-tech.
E-tech is an online sale platform for electronic goods. Our project is based on many similar famous online
markets such as Amazon, Lazada, Alibaba, .etc. For the previous mentioned reasons, E-tech is a worthy
project to operate as it fulfill peopleâ€™s need for convenience as well as giving enterprises reach to their
customers faster and easier
